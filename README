A simple calculator GUI. 

You can run this application by entering "python Main.py" (if using the 
command prompt) or by double-clicking the file. Python 2.7 (or a higher
version) is required.

Capable of performing one of four arithmetic operations: addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Uses infix notation. E.g. the sum of 2 and 2 would be computed by clicking
the button labelled "2", then the "+" button, and then "2" again, followed
by the "=" button. In more general form, 

    FIRST_OPERAND  OPERATOR  SECOND_OPERAND  EQUALS

Does not support operations entailing more than one operator or more than
two operands. Also does not support decimal operands, although the output
will be represented in decimal form if necessary.
